# 👋 Hi there, I'm **Juanma**

I'm a **Backend Software Engineer** from 🇪🇸 Spain, currently working in the **Fintech** industry.  
My main language at work is **Python**, but these days I'm especially interested in **Golang**.  

🔧 I enjoy building tools and small infrastructure-related projects to learn more about systems and automation.

## 📌 Current Focus

- Learning more about **Go** and **Infrastructure as Code**
- Building personal projects that help me improve my understanding of backend performance and deployment pipelines
